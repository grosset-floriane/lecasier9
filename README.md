# Le Casier 9

## Introduction
Le Casier 9 is an online gallery that I founded during my bachelor of Fine Arts in France at the Ecole Superieure des Arts et Medias de Caen.
The code written in this repository is an archive of what the website looked like in 2014.
I was the author of HTML and CSS. Maxime Grosset, my brother, wrote the PHP part and helped me to make it more efficient.

The website is still available at: http://lecasier9.free.fr

## Context

During the bachelor's, there was no possibility to exhibit art as being an art student in France wasn't recognized as being an artist already. Therefore, my fellows were feeling a kind of frustration not having the possibility to share their works. Even among students, we had no idea what the others were doing if we were not close friends.

That's how the idea of an online gallery came up, and I started to promote the project first to my classmates. After one or two exhibitions together, I decided to open it to the whole school and even artists who recently graduated.

## Genesis of the project and team building

As the project started, many of my classmates were interested in taking part in it, and I received a lot of help to create the design, choose fonts, choose the title and get a logo. Then, I decided to reduce the team to people I trusted, and I wanted to collaborate with: Sandy Kalaydjian, Lola Jacrot, Olivier Le Borgne, and Stanca Soare.

## Gallery running process

Every other month, the students could contribute to exhibitions in response to a theme such as Absence or Movement. There were no selections made of the students' applications, and we included every submission.

To advertise the open call, we created posters by researching the dictionary definitions of each themes word and using images that evoke the theme meaning. As soon as we had gathered the works, the team members began formatting the content to be published and prepared flyers. I was in charge of curating and uploading the content online.

## Limitations 

As it is an old project, there are some pitfalls. 

First of all, the design is not responsive anymore. I wrote unperfect media queries that are not interpreted as they should by smartphones browsers.

Second, there was no database. The server I was using, Free, was a clumsy host for the website, and I did not know MySQL at the time. That means that every time I had to upload a new exhibition, I was creating PHP files containing HTML and taking care that every page was working the way it should. 

## Conclusion

After completing my bachelor's, I went to another school to do my Master of Fine Arts. So I decided to leave the project behind me. The website was linked tightly with the school space, and it felt right to leave it as it is: an archive of students' artworks.

After my Master's, I created another online gallery, which uses code as the primary material to create artworks: https://waawgallery.com
